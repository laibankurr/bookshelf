# Book shelp app

# Description

This is a simple book shelf app that is implemented using "Class type" component instead of the "Functional type".

This app is implemented a component that takes information from the API and shows it using "LifeCycle" functions such as "ComponentDidMount".

Use the api provided by udacity. By creating BooksAPI.js, I have implemented the ability to fetch and retrieve data from this file. Because this app does not use server, it memorize user's status by storing token in local storage.
